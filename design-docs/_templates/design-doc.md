# Design Doc: [Feature/Project Name]

Date: 2025-XX-XX
Author(s): [@your_username]
Status: [Proposed | In Review | Approved | Deprecated]

## Context & Problem

    What are we trying to solve? (1-2 sentences)
    A clear, concise statement of the problem.
    Example: Users are dropping off at the final step of the checkout process.
    Why is this a problem? (1-2 sentences, include data if possible)
    Explain the impact. Is it affecting users, revenue, or internal processes?
    Example: This results in a 15% cart abandonment rate, directly impacting our monthly revenue and requiring manual follow-up from the sales team.

## Goals & Non-Goals

    Goals (What will success look like?)
    Reduce checkout abandonment by 5%.
    Improve the user experience of the payment step.
    Add another success metric.
    Non-Goals (What are we explicitly not trying to solve right now?)
    Overhauling the entire multi-page checkout flow.
    Adding new payment methods (e.g., Apple Pay, Klarna).
    Add another item we are deferring.

## Proposed Solution

    High-Level Approach
    Describe the core idea of your solution in a sentence or two.
    Example: We will simplify the payment form by removing optional fields and adding a visual progress indicator to reduce cognitive load and provide a sense of momentum.
    Key Changes
    Remove the 'Company Name' and 'Address Line 2' fields from the form.
    Implement a 'Step 3 of 3' header to manage user expectations.
    Redesign the primary 'Pay Now' call-to-action button for better visibility.
    Visuals / Links
    A picture is worth a thousand words. Link to a quick sketch, wireframe, or even a photo of a whiteboard drawing.

## Rationale & Alternatives Considered

    Why this approach?
    Briefly justify your choice. Why is this the right solution for now?
    Example: This solution is the fastest to implement and directly addresses the user feedback we've received about form complexity and length.
    Alternatives Briefly Considered
    One-click payment integration: Discarded for now due to high engineering effort and third-party dependencies.
    A complete checkout page redesign: Discarded as it's too broad; we want to test this specific, targeted change first.
